**Lighthouse** is a lightweight, Python-based failover management system designed to ensure high availability for long-running processes such as bots or services (e.g., Discord bots). It uses a master-slave architecture where one node is active and others are ready to take over automatically if the master fails.

## 🔧 Features

- Simple failover logic using HTTP and JSON configs
- Master-slave role management
- Automatic slave promotion if the master goes down
- RESTful API for monitoring and control
- Callback registration for custom start/stop logic
- Option to pass the Flask app and port to the start callback
- Configurable monitoring interval

## 📁 Structure

- `Lighthouse` class (main logic)
- `config.json` (node role and network info)
- `bot_main.py` (or any custom code to run as the main process)

## 🚀 Usage

### 0. Install Requirements

Before running Lighthouse, install the required Python packages:

```sh
pip install flask waitress requests
```

### 1. Prepare `config.json`

You can optionally add a `name` field to your config for easier identification in status responses. The `name` parameter is not required.

Example for a **master**:

```json
{
  "role": "master",
  "self_addr": "127.0.0.1:5000",
  "slaves": ["127.0.0.1:5001", "127.0.0.1:5002"],
  "name": "Main Node" // Optional
}
```

Example for a **slave**:

```json
{
  "role": "slave",
  "self_addr": "127.0.0.1:5001",
  "parent_addr": "127.0.0.1:5000",
  "slaves": [],
  "name": "Backup Node 1" // Optional
}
```

### 2. Create Your Main Bot or Process

For example, in `bot_main.py`:

```python
import time

while True:
    print("Bot running...")
    time.sleep(5)
```

> Replace `bot_main.py` with your actual script — it can be a Discord bot or any other long-running service.

### 3. Start Lighthouse

In your `main.py`:

```python
from Lighthouse.Lighthouse import Lighthouse
import subprocess
from flask import Flask

lh = Lighthouse("config.json")
proc = None

@lh.start_callback
def start():
    global proc
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["python3", "bot_main.py"])

@lh.stop_callback
def stop():
    global proc
    if proc and proc.poll() is None:
        proc.terminate()
        proc.wait()

@lh.update_callback
def update(data):
    print("Received update:", data)
    # Handle update logic here

# Optionally, you can pass a Flask app instance to lh.run(app=your_app)
# For example:
# app = Flask(__name__)
# lh.run(app=app)
lh.run()
```

### 4. Advanced: Pass Flask App and Port

If your bot or service needs access to the Flask app or dynamic port, use `pass_flask_app=True`:

```python
lh = Lighthouse("config.json", pass_flask_app=True)

@lh.start_callback
def start(app, port):
    print(f"Starting with Flask app on port {port}")
    # Your bot code here, using `app` if needed
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

| Parameter         | Description                                                        | Default      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `config_path`    | Path to the JSON file that defines the node’s role, address, peers | *(required)*|
| `pass_flask_app` | Pass `Flask` app and port to `start_callback()`                    | `False`     |
| `interval`       | Time (in seconds) between monitor checks                           | `5`         |

## 📡 API Endpoints

* `GET /status` – Returns current status and known slaves
* `POST /reset` – Stops main code and resets status
* `POST /stop` – Gracefully stops the main code
* `POST /update` – Calls the registered update callback with the JSON body of the request
* `GET /sync` – Returns the last update received by this node (used for state synchronization between nodes)

## 🛠️ Notes

* All API endpoints are registered on the Flask app.
* The class is designed for extensibility via callbacks.
* For advanced usage, see the DOCUMENTATION.md and code comments.
* Use different ports and IPs per node
* All nodes must be able to reach each other via HTTP
* Ensure the bot process is stateless or uses external storage for shared state
* Consider using a process manager like `systemd` or `supervisord` for production
